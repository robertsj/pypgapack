A lightweight Python wrapper for PGAPack
========================================

CONTENTS

./README
  That's this file.

doc/
  Contains documentation for using pypgapack.  The Python-specific API
  is lightly documented, and the user is urged to read the PGAPack
  documentation for more details.
pypgapack/
  Contains the sources and other files needed for creating the 
  Python module and associated documentation.  
pypgapack/
  Contains the PGAPack sources.  The PGAPack library is built within
  the CMake framework of pypgapack.  Hence, the older build system, 
  while present, is not used.  Two slight modifications were made.  Now
  a configuration header is used based on CMake arguments, and the 
  pgapack.h header was made safe for use in C++ code.
examples/
  Contains several examples illustrating pypgapack.  Run the script
  "run_examples.py" to verify against some reference output.

INSTALLATION

CMake is used for the build.  The way I like to do the builds is as
follows.

1. Create a head pypgapack head folder and go there:
  
  >>> mkdir /path/to/pypgapack
  >>> cd /path/to/pypgpapack

2. Get the pypgapack repository, naming it source;

  >>> git clone git://github.com/robertsj/pypgapack.git source

3. Make a build directory and go there:
  
  >>> mkdir build
  >>> cd build

4. Configure and build.

  >>> cmake -D \
      CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/pypgapack/install \
      /path/to/pypgapack/source 
  >>> make install

That's it for the serial build.
