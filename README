A lightweight Python wrapper for PGAPack
========================================

CONTENTS

./README
  That's this file.

doc/
  Contains documentation for using PyPGAPack.  The Python-specific API
  is lightly documented, and the user is urged to read the PGAPack
  documentation for more details.
pypgapack/
  Contains the sources and a simple build script for creating the 
  Python module and associated documentation.  
patch/
  Contains a few patches for the PGAPack build system to enable building
  a shared library and using C++.
examples/
  Contains several examples illustrating pypgapack.

INSTALLATION

You *must* have a *shared* version of the PGAPack library installed.  You 
can get the source from:

  http://ftp.mcs.anl.gov/pub/pgapack/

PGAPack requires a C compiler and can also be built with MPI.  On the
other hand, pypgapack requires a C++ compiler.  I've only tested with
the GNU tool set.  Build and read the documentation for use of the
included patches to PGAPack to make this part of the build work.  To do
this, execute

  >>> cd ./doc
  >>> make html; make latex; make latexpdf;

Thats it!  See the examples for use.
